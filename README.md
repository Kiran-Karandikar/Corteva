## Problem 1

To implement the solution, Django's ORM was used. The database schema is shown
below and can be found in `/base/core/models.py`.

```python
from django.db import models

class WeatherStation(models.Model):
    """
    Model class to store station details.
    """

    weather_station = models.CharField(max_length=40, help_text="Station ID.")

    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class WeatherDetails(WeatherStation):
    record_date = models.DateField(
        help_text="Record date.", verbose_name="Record date."
    )
    max_temp = models.FloatField(
        help_text="Max temp (in 0.1째C).",
    )
    min_temp = models.FloatField(
        help_text="Min temp (in 0.1째C).",
    )
    precip = models.FloatField(
        help_text="Precipitation (in 0.1mm).",
    )
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(
        auto_now_add=True,
        null=False,
        verbose_name="Created on.",
    )
    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(
        auto_now=True, verbose_name="Last updated.", null=False
    )

    class Meta:
        ordering = ["weather_station"]
        constraints = [
            models.UniqueConstraint(
                fields=[
                    "weather_station",
                    "record_date",
                    "max_temp",
                    "min_temp",
                    "precip",
                ],
                name="Valid record by station, record and weather details.",
            )
        ]

class WeatherStats(WeatherStation):
    year = models.IntegerField(help_text="Stats done this year.")
    max_temp_avg = models.FloatField(
        null=True,
        help_text="Avg max temp (in 째C).",
    )
    min_temp_avg = models.FloatField(
        null=True,
        help_text="Avg min temp (in 째C).",
    )
    total_precip = models.FloatField(
        null=True,
        help_text="Total precip (in cm).",
    )

    created_on = models.DateTimeField(
        auto_now_add=True,
        null=False,
        verbose_name="Created on.",
    )
    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(
        auto_now=True, verbose_name="Last updated.", null=False
    )

    class Meta:
        ordering = ["weather_station", "year"]
        constraints = [
            models.UniqueConstraint(
                fields=["weather_station", "year"],
                name="Valid Stats by station, record and weather details.",
            )
        ]
```

## Problem 2

The Django management command `ingest_weather_data` was used for data ingestion.
The command can be executed by running `python manage.py ingest_weather_data`.
The total ingestion time is:

> The constraints defined in the database model ensure that duplicate data is
not inserted.

## Problem 3

TBD

## Problem 4

To implement the solution, the Django REST framework was used. Follow the steps
below to get started:

```shell
docker build .
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

* To view the Swagger API documentation, navigate to `localhost:8000/api/docs` or `
  localhost:8000/api/rdocs/`.
* To access the weather data, go to `localhost:8000/api/weather`.
* For data analysis, visit `localhost:8000/api/weather/stats`.


Please note that the `.envs` directory contains environment variables that
should not be committed to GitHub. For brevity reasons, they are included in
this repository.

## Problem 5: Deployment

Although I do not have experience deploying to AWS, I can provide some insights
based on my experience deploying to Azure. To achieve this, I intend to utilize
the following services:

* Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server as the database
* Azure App Services to host the web application
* Azure Data Factory for data ingestion and analysis generation.
